// Create a function that takes the filepath (e.g. "da_vinci_code.txt") as an input, reads the given file, and counts the occurences of 0, 1 and x characters in it.
// The function should return a dictionary in which the searched characters are the keys and the number of their occurences are the values.
// For example:
//
// var countedLetters = CountLetters("da_vinci_code.txt");
// Console.WriteLine("0 occured {0} times in the file.", countedLetters["0"]);
// Console.WriteLine("1 occured {0} times in the file.", countedLetters["1"]);
// Console.WriteLine("x occured {0} times in the file.", countedLetters["x"]);
// 
// Should print:
// 0 occured 3393 times in the file.
// 1 occured 3375 times in the file.
// x occured 3232 times in the file.
