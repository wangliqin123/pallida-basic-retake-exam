In OOP inheritence is one of the fundamental attributes.It allows you to define a child class 
that inherits, extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class.
The derived class inherit all members of the base class except contructors.
The derived class would be able to acces those members would 
depend upon the acessibility of those members in the base class.
Use inheritence when you have a base class, and derived classes, 
and you want to give acces derived classes to the base class.
